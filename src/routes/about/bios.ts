	lola: `<p>I’m Lola van Praag, a Dutch textile and fashion designer with a love for bold ideas, intricate processes, and materials that surprise you. My background is rooted in both traditional craft and industrial technique—I studied Fashion Design at the Willem de Kooning Academy and went on to complete two master’s degrees: one in Textile Design at the Swedish School of Textiles, specialising in knitting and print, and one in Menswear at the University of Westminster, where I showed my final collection during London Fashion Week.<p>Alongside this, I’ve always continued my personal practice, exhibiting work from Amsterdam Fashion Week to Salone del Mobile in Milan.<p>I’m endlessly curious about how things are made. Whether working with glitter, reclaimed yarns, foil, or industrial knitting machines, I love challenging standard methods and finding new ways to push materials beyond their expected use. My work often lives in the space where hand and machine meet—where precise technique collides with playful experimentation.<p>Over the years, I’ve led design teams, developed hundreds of textiles per season, and worked hands-on with advanced knitting technologies during my time at BYBORRE. Alongside that, I’m committed to staying sharp and up to date—currently taking a deep dive into AI tools and exploring how they can support and expand my practice. I see it as a natural extension of my approach: combining digital and manual processes to create something tactile, unexpected, and new.<p>Sustainability is also central to how I work—from material choices to long-term thinking—and I care deeply about building a creative practice that fosters community and collaboration. I believe that good design is not only shaped in the studio, but also in the quieter moments—walking through a garden, flipping through an old book, or stepping away to notice something small.<p>In 2024, I launched Paillette—a print-focused studio where expressive surfaces, shimmering textures, and experimental techniques come together in prints that feel bold, tactile, and full of life.`,
	larissa: `<p>As a Dutch-Singaporean designer raised between two continents I bring a global perspective of cultures, textures and traditions to my design practice. With a background in fashion and a love for textile design, I explore how colour, texture, and illustration come together to create expressive, otherworldly prints.<p>During my time studying Fashion for a bachelors, did my love for drawing and illustration truly take root, and it continues to be a core part of my creative process today. It is grounded in observation , intuition, and tactile experimentation. Drawing from life capturing fleeting moments, and often using photo references to further explore detail and nuance, I blend both analogue and digital tools to create richly layered prints often playing with an array of colour.<p>If you're looking to bring bold, story-rich prints to life, then my prints are the perfect fit!`,
	linde: `<p>As a Belgian designer with a background in fashion and a love for crossing creative boundaries, I bring an interdisciplinary spirit to my print design practice. During my studies at KASK in Ghent, I was drawn to collaboration and experimentation—developing textiles alongside the Philippe Vandenberg Foundation for my bachelor’s collection, and working as a studio assistant to artist Peter Buggenhout during my master’s research.<p>My approach to print design is rooted in this same playful curiosity. Inspired by my environment, I combine paint, pencil, collage, and photography to build vibrant, graphic compositions—always seeking out a sense of loving chaos. Blurring the lines between mediums and embracing soft imperfection, I create prints that feel intuitive, layered, and alive.<p>If you're looking to inject boldness, personality, and a touch of poetic disorder into your project, my prints offer just that.`,
	filipa: `<p>With a background in both Fashion & Fabric Design and Fine Arts, I discovered my love for illustration during my fashion studies—drawn to its power to breathe life into ideas through expressive lines, textures, and colour. Today, illustration is at the heart of my creative practice, where I explore the interplay between traditional techniques and contemporary aesthetics.<p>My approach is rooted in movement, emotion, and a sharp eye for detail. Whether working on prints, visuals, or storytelling elements, I aim to create elegant, dynamic compositions that bridge the worlds of fashion, art, and illustration. Ever curious, I’m constantly seeking new ways to connect visual language with material experience.<p>If you're looking for refined, expressive work that captures energy and narrative, I’d love to collaborate.`,
	margarida: `<p>I’m a textile and print designer from Lisbon, Portugal, with a background in textile arts and fashion design, studied between Lisbon and London. My work explores the space where texture meets movement and graphic structure. I'm deeply inspired by layers, visual rhythm, and the tactile imperfections that emerge when analog and digital techniques collide.<p>A fun fact: I’m obsessed with paper. I collect all kinds—scraps, samples, even receipts—hoping to one day bind them into a strange, beautiful book. I gravitate toward slightly muted, off-tones of primary colours that add a subtle edge to vibrant palettes.<p>Over the years, I’ve worked with a fabric design company, collaborated with print-forward designers like Richard Quinn, and currently work with Portuguese designer Constança Entrudo, whose work celebrates bold colour and experimental surface design.<p>If you're looking for bold, layered prints that combine colour, texture, and a mix of traditional and digital techniques, I’d love to collaborate.`,

	lucy: `<p>I'm a fashion and textiles designer from Dublin, Ireland, currently working in theatre with a background in costume design for film, stage, and performance. My creative process begins with photography—capturing the city around me—then layering these with scans of mark-making and screen prints to bring texture and depth into my designs.<p>I’m curious about pushing traditional textile techniques into unexpected directions, often blending confident graphic shapes with experimental, hand-made elements. Colour plays a key role in my work—especially unconventional combinations that evoke a retro, rebellious edge.<p>Whether for stage or street, my prints are bold, vibrant, and rich with storytelling—designed to leave a lasting visual impression.`,
	wendy: `<p>With a background in fashion design and a soft spot for tiny details, my work is all about layering meaning and personality into each piece. I love creating prints that feel playful and expressive—where every element has a reason to be there (even if it’s a weird one). Whether drawing inspiration from books, clothing, or odd little things I find around me, I blend the quirky with the contemporary to create designs that are both intricate and fun.<p>My aesthetic balances the polished with the casual: earthy tones meet bold patterns, and refined linework plays alongside unexpected forms. I like to think of design as a way to express how I see the world—curious, sometimes chaotic, but always with a wink.`,
	amina: `<p>With a strong interest in cinema and screen culture, I explore these influences through print by playing with scale, colour, texture, and repeated patterns. My designs often use gradients and halftone effects to create dreamy, organic, and futuristic moods that invite a fresh way of seeing.<p>I recently graduated from École Duperré with a Bachelor’s in Textile Research and Development for Fashion and Home, and I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Textile Design with a focus on Print at the Swedish School of Textiles. My practice is rooted in everyday life—I observe, photograph, and sketch moments and details that often go unnoticed, crafting patterns that encourage the eye to pause and shift perception.<p>If you’re looking for prints that balance subtle complexity with bold visual impact, my work offers a unique blend of observation and innovation.`
